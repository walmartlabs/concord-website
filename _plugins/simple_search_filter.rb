# NOTE: Legacy plugin retained only for reference. Not used by current site build.
# Safe to delete if desired. Original purpose: provide `remove_chars` Liquid
# filter to sanitize content for search index generation.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Disabled: original simple_search_filter.rb removed for GitHub Pages compatibility.
# The custom Liquid filter `remove_chars` has been eliminated from templates.
# This file intentionally left minimal.
