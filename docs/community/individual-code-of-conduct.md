# {{ page.title }}

Like the larger technical community, the Concord community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers
from all over the world, working on all aspect of Concord. We see this diversity as one of our huge strengths, because
when people of diverse backgrounds come together to build a shared system, the result is better for everyone.

This is why we encourage everyone, especially those with different perspectives, to communicate openly and frequently.
To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code of conduct applies equally to all
participants in the Concord project.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a
guide to make communication easier and to benefit us all and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Concord project. This includes Slack, the mailing lists,
the issue tracker, Concord events, and any other forums created by the project team, which the community uses for
communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing `concord-team@walmartlabs.com`.

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration
status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any
decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions. Remember that we are a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary
language.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor
manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
productive one. Members of the Concord community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
people outside the Concord community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are serious about the work we do, and we conduct ourselves
professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or disparage other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Concord
is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we are
different. The strength of Concord comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different
people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that
they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on
helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
