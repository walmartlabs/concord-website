# {{ page.title }}

The `s3` task allows users to work with S3-compatible object stores.

<a name="usage"/>

## Usage

To be able to use the task in a Concord flow, it must be added as a
[dependency](../processes-v2/configuration.html#dependencies):

```yaml
configuration:
  dependencies:
  - mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins:s3-task:{{ site.concord_plugins_version }}
```

This adds the task to the classpath and allows you to invoke the task in a flow:

## Common Parameters

- `action` - (mandatory) action to perform:
  - `getObject` - [download](#get-object) an object from the store;
  - `putObject` - [upload](#put-object) an object to the store.
- `endpoint` - string, the store API endpoint, if not specified the default
Amazon S3 endpoint is used;
- `region` - (mandatory) string, the store's region;
- `autoCreateBucket` - boolean, create the s3 bucket specified if required;
- `pathStyleAccess` - boolean, enables [the path-style access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)
which is used by some of S3 implementations;
- `auth` - (mandatory) authentication parameters:
  - `basic`
    - `accessKey` - string, the endpoint's access key;
    - `secretKey` - string, the endpoint's secret key;
- `bucketName` - (mandatory) string, name of the object's bucket;
- `objectKey` - (mandatory) string, the object's key;
- `ignoreErrors` - boolean, if `true` any errors that occur during
the execution will be ignored and stored in the `result` variable;

## Get Object

The `getObject` action is used to download objects from the store and save them
as temporary files in the process' working directory.

```yaml
- task: s3
  in:
    action: "getObject"
    region: "us-east-1"
    auth:
      basic:
        accessKey: "..."
        secretKey: "..."
    bucketName: "myBucket"
    objectKey: "myObject"
  out: result

- log: "Saved as ${result.path}"
```

The result is stored in the `result` variable:
- `ok` - boolean, `true` if the execution is successful;
- `path` - string, path of the downloaded object;
- `error` - string, error message (if `ignoreErrors` is `false`).

## Put Object

The `putObject` action is used to upload files from the process' working
directory into the object store.

```yaml
- task: s3
  in:
    action: "putObject"
    region: "us-east-1"
    auth:
      basic:
        accessKey: "..."
        secretKey: "..."
    bucketName: "myBucket"
    objectKey: "myObject"
    src: "local.file"
  out: result
```
