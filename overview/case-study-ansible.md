title: Case Study - Ansible at Scale
---

One of the initial use cases Concord was created to support, is the execution
of Ansible playbooks at Walmart.

Numerous success stories at Walmart have proven Concord to be a first class tool
for Ansible users.

Following are some characteristics:

- Large scale usage for Walmart Pharmacy, Optical, and Tire and Lube Express
- Approximately scaled to 3000 to over 5000 stores for each scenario
- Each store contains up to a dozen endpoints
- Endpoints are a mixture of Linux, Windows server and Windows workstation
  installations
- All endpoints are controlled by playbooks with a lot of shared configuration
- Runs hit between 5k and 65k endpoints each time
- Runs are performed for regular release cycles up to multiple times a week
- Successfully replaced numerous proprietary and legacy applications
- Less than 1% failure rate, down significantly from prior systems
- Large gains in speed of execution factor 10x and better
